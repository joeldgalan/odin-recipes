            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Mofongo might not look like much, but it sure is tasty. Mashed green plantains with garlic, olive oil and pork rinds (or bacon). Mofongo goes well with chicken or fish broth and can be stuffed with garlic shrimp, carne frita or octopus salad. It can also be formed into small balls and dropped in soups or served directly in a mortar.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3 cups canola oil for frying</li>
